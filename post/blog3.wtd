## Overview
My Kindle scribe 2024 is basically the original 2022 kindle scribe but with some slight improvements such as the new colours and more. I use a case for it. I am not really an artist or drawer but I am an avid reader.
## The Pros
The Pros includes the paper like feel, it feels nice, unlike the glossy Ipad, I can feel the friction that resembles a real pen, when I first got it, I did not expect it to feel that way. The large screen is useful to read lots of text in one page and also the paper like thickness feels very lightweight, unless I use a case which makes it useless. It has access to the kindle store for me to get millions of books that goes from Jk Rowling's to Tristan Banck's books. The battery life can last multiple weeks too, sometimes I leave my Scribe for a week or two and yet find it still high on battery. There are many templates from grids to checklists, you should be able to find community made ones online.
## The Cons
The problem is that unlike the more recent Kindle Scribe Coloursoft, the screen is still black and white which won't feel good for reading illustrative books which I don't usually read. The browser is inheritly terrible due to lacking enough javascript to do things other than reading articles or small gaming. There is not a large library that take advantage of the Kindle Scribe's drawing ability but you can get through it, just that they are not that popular. The upgrades from the Original Kindle Scribe to the 2024 one besides Aesthetics is not much so if you can find a 2022 Kindle Scribe for like a hundred dollars cheaps, get that instead. Don't forget, the tip also wears off in like a month or two. your only probably going to last 8 month or above with the tips already given to you.

## The Summary Table
---
| Pros / Cons
- The screen feels like paper, good to draw / Lack of colour screen
-  Large screen / Terrible browser, not enough Javascript to do fun things
- Very thin / Not alot of Kindle Books take advantage of the pen
- Good Battery life / Not that different from the original Kindle Scribe
- Various Drawing templates / The tip can wear off rather quickily

## Reading experience
It is like any other Kindle but I can start drawing on the book as drawable notes and drawing side panel. I only use the pen there to play aroud highlighting and swiping through pages. I can still read, the text is very clear and there is Bookerly, animated page turns and integration with text to speech reader which I use to listen to books.

## Conclusion
The Kindle Scribe 2024 is a modest drawing tablet and an excellent ereader to read on the go with the very thin thickness and its paperlike screen, don't forget about the pen and it can do anything the other models can do. The problems is more niche and not as effective such as the lack of modern Javascript for advanced websites and how the tip wears out quickily. I reccomend you to get it if you can't find a much cheaper Kindle Scribe 2022 and you don't care about the colour screens.
